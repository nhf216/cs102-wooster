# cs102-wooster
Attempting to make JES media.py functions work in Python 3 without Java.  This codebase is used in CS 102: Multimedia Computing at The College of Wooster.

This code depends on PyQt5 or on both PyQt4 and PIL/pillow.  It supports PyQt4 because we often run the code in Enthought Canopy in our course.  Canopy currently has PyQt4 in its package manager, but it does not have PyQt5 yet.  PyQt5 support began to be added in December 2018 to facilitate portability of this module outside Canopy.
